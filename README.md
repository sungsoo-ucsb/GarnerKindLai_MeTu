## Installation

All necessary packages for R, Python, and Matlab should be installed. Installation instructions can be found at homepages of those packages. We used the most recent packages as of March, 2024.

There is no required hardware other than a computer that can run R, Python, and Matlab (most recent versions as of March, 2024).

Git clone or download the current repository.


## Running the code.

EM analyses: Run the main script in the folder.

Two-photon calcium imaging: Run the main_analysis script. Raw imaging files will be provided upon request. Intermediate data files are available in each folder.






See the Key Resources Table for required software. Installation instructions of those packages can be found in the link provided in the Key Resources Table. Installation of these required packages may vary depending on the computer specifications. Our code does not require special installation. After downloading (or clone) the code, each files can be run to replicate the results.
